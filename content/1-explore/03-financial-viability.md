## Why

`Sometimes there is a gap in the market becuase there's no market in the gap` - _Irene Bejenke Walsh_ 
Products can have a good value proposition with an appealing message. If the product can’t sell enough to cover expenses and make enough profit to sustain the business long term there’s a considerable risk in pursuing it. Carry out financial viability assessments for each product idea to select the best one.


## How

- Addressable market size
This should be big enough to have customers to generate revenues to make the business scalable. Identify the potential volumes that can be sold in this market. It helps the economies of scale considering the cost per sale.

- Breakeven Analysis
Do a detailed Breakeven Analysis to determine viability based on the market size to decide product price that cover the costs / breakeven. E.g: if the breakeven price is already higher than the closest competitive product, it’s challenging to sustain long term. 

- Does ROI compensate for the financial risks involved?
Two aspects to consider is time and money invested on the product against the compensation mode. In terms of money what’s the expected return and how long will it take to breakeven and make profits.

A good way to verify your assessment based on the 3 aspects given is to find a few comparable product companies. Work out how these businesses reached their breakeven and how long it took.
