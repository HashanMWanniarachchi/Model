During the explore stage, you usually come up with a vast amount of ideas and value propositions the product may offer. Success of a product has no direct relevance to the excess of features it offers. A smaller set of cohesive, tuned (targeted) feature set is usually more effective than a large set of features.

Focus is where you narrow down the attention to the most important aspects such as market segment, value proposition, brand story and the overall solution architecture.
