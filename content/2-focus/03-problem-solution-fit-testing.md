## Why
According to a post mortem research of global startups conducted by the venture capital database [CB Insights](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/), the most common reason why new ventures fail is because they build and launch something customers don’t want or don't want to pay for. If your target customers need to be 'educated' for them to understand the need for your product, you are probably solving a non-existing problem.

Before investing months or years of effort towards building a product, determine early if this product is something worth doing.

## How

- There is no other way of testing your problem solution fit without talking to your potential customers. You can make calls, meetings, surveys to collect information of how important it’s for them to have the identified problem solved.
- Some of the common question areas to focus on are:

  - How do customers rate your value proposition? Nice to have, Should have or Must have? It’s difficult to build a business model around 'Nice to have' ideas
  - How many customers are willing to immediately try out your product through their business processes when a working solution is available?
  - What is the price point your customers are ready to pay for the solution you offer?
  - What are the features customers would buy given each feature is $1000 and they have a $3000 budget?

- Pivot if your test results are not favorable to the solution you are offering. Repeat the testing until you find a problem worth solving (A problem where customers draw cheques even before the solution is built).
