## Why
QA plan is critically important to ensure the quality of the product or service.  It helps to,
- Ensure the quality of the product.
- Makes sure that the product meets the set regulatory standards mentioned in service level agreements.
- Monitor and control the level of quality and other matrices to analyze trends and thereby continuously improve.
- Describes the specific document standards, practices, procedures, and thus improves the communication within the team.
- Establish trust and confidence in the business among customers and helps the company compete with others in the same market.


## How
The end goal of quality management should be to come up with an end-to-end process to ensure the quality of your product. There are two main aspects.

**Quality Assurance (QA)**
Quality assurance is about preventing a defect from ever happening. It is a proactive measure and focuses on following a correct procedure to avoid bugs. The following needs to be considered here.
- Understand the quality requirements of the product.
- Communication and build awareness to make sure that quality is viewed as a team responsibility.
- Build test cases around features and non-functional requirements.
- Invest in test automation.

**Quality Control (QC)**
On the other hand, quality control is about ensuring that the product maintains a certain quality threshold. It is a reactive approach to ensuring that nothing that does not meet the quality requirements is shipped. The following needs to be considered here.
- Executing quality verification processes, such as regressions and smoke testing.
- Making sure that the DevOps pipeline fails when the automated tests fail.
- Making sure at least the non-functional requirements stated in the SLAs are tested. 

Considering both QA & QC aspects, the following actions can be used to build a test plan.
- Ensure Quality objectives are identified.
- Define QA Roles and responsibilities.
- Coordinate with developers, scrum masters, product owners. QA plan should be aligned with the other management plans such as risk management plan, change management plan and resource management plan.
- Define methodologies and standards. Risk management standards, project management standards, information security standards, data protection and privacy standards, business domain-related standards, etc. need to be considered here.
- Determine QA tasks and schedule.
- Gather details on testing, staging and production environments.
- Plan, review and audit. Thereby continuously improve.
