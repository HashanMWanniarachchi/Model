## Why
The theme of the product represents how you would want customers to perceive your product. It is the basis for branding and thus, it must not be taken lightly. It is important to reflect this theme in every corner of the user experience. The developers should be both aware of and know how to apply this in their day to day work. Guidelines and standards on how to do that should be in place from the beginning of the product life cycle.


## How
Consider the following to enable developers to integrate product themes into development better.

- Theme establishment
The product theme should be in place now. Try to document the primary principles of the theme and try to understand its deep meaning. The theme is more than just UI elements. It covers the interactions, user flows and user moods. 

- Establish theme guidelines and standards
It is also important to establish a theme guideline for developers to adhere to based on the overall product theme. It should be detailed as possible and also should cover all different aspects of the user interface.

- Sample implementation
Try to have the product theme implemented in a small vertical from the very beginning. It will act as a reference for implementation for features to come.
