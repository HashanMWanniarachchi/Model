Usually, growth hacking comes in handy when you desire a certain level of growth. Still, you don’t have the necessary resources (i.e.: time and money) to do it in traditional means. On a different page, even though you have enough resources, most business ideas are naturally executed on the default path of thinking. Few growths hacks on the way help product to take leaps that increase the chance of succeeding.

- Collaborate power of many departments of your organization such as Marketing, Product, Engineering, and Sales. It helps with brainstorming and communication.
- Do some homework within the larger team. Come up with a few possible ideas for growth hacking, warm-up, and make sure everyone’s on the same page.
- Educate your customer and organize a meeting involving a few stakeholders across different teams (marketing, product, engineering).
- Discuss each stage of the Pirate Tunnel and come up with experiments that you could do to create growth.
