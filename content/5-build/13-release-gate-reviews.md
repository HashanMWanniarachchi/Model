## Why
Release gate reviews help projects to,

- Decide as to whether to proceed to the next phase in the project or not
- Minimize project risk through evaluating checklists maintained for each phase
- Reduce development cycle time by ensuring the team gets it done right the first time
  Most importantly, release gate reviews helps the team and all stakeholders to determine whether the project is on track.

## How

- The team should determine the phases as to when the release gate review should be undertaken. e.g. Project initiation, Design, Development, Testing etc..
- Once the phases have been identified, the team should create appropriate checklists to evaluate.
- A structured Release Gate Review Process should be in place
- Deliverables of the preceding phase should be reviewed to ensure all prerequisites have been met for the next phase to succeed.
  - E.g. A team should not start coding if the design phase has not been completed based on previously accepted completion criteria
    If a deliverable from the preceding phase does not meet the accepted completion criteria for some reason, the team should conduct a Root Cause Analysis and try to rectify the issue.
- The team may conditionally proceed to the next phase if specific deliverables from the preceding phase have not met the accepted completion criteria. Exceptions, as such, should be communicated to all stakeholders, and approvals, if required, should be obtained.
