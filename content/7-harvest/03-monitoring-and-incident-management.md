## Why

Unmanaged exceptions and incidents could lead to breach SLA (Service Level Agreements) with customers, face penalties, and portray a negative brand image in the marketplace.

## How

Exceptions and incidents could occur in any software product, but having the right monitoring and management process will be able to minimize the negative impact of such incidents.

- Understand the SLA requirements

- To cover areas of SLA have logged in place within components and subsystems

- Have a monitoring tool to detect issue by analyzing the logs, prioritize, diagnose

- Have an incident reporting tool to manage the issue backlog

- Meantime users can report incidents

- Based on the agreed SLA incident must be resolved to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction

- A root cause analysis of incidents needs to be performed to minimize similar issues being occurred in the future.
