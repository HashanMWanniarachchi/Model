## What

Start educating prospects, build awareness of your organization and its products. Build trust and build a good relationship making it more likely that the potential client will choose you when it's time to buy.

## Why

First time visitor to your site is not coming to purchase. They are coming for information collection. Unless you build a lasting relationship with these visitors, they hardly get converted to a sale. It is [observed](https://www.invespcro.com/blog/lead-nurturing/) that companies with successful lead nurturing generate 50% more sales-ready leads at a 33% lower cost.

## How

- Analyze the persona to target and understand what convinces them to buy
- Design your nurturing flow
  - Define the touchpoints
  - Plan valuable content offers
  - Decide the frequency
  - Decide the contact channels
- You may use different channels as suitable for your audience
  - Emails
  - Social Media Retargeting
  - Display Retargeting
  - Surveys
  - One-on-one interactions such as calls, meetings
  - Meet in-person
- Establish automatic lead scoring to trigger notifications to sales team regarding high-ranked leads
- Measure your results, review and improve
