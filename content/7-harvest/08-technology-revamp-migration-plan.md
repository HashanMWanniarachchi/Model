## Why
`the only thing that is constant is change.` - _Heraclitus_
This is also true for environment which software product businesses are in, therefore to meet the needs of the business ecosystem software must constantly evolve both in terms of business model and technology. Not having up to date technologies can lead to inability to change product features on time to meet business needs such as releasing important features on time, scale out on demand, reduce operation cost, improve security, improve user experience etc.   

## How

Technology revamp must have a business case in order to get buy-in of all the stakeholders. Technology revamp or updates must be a continuos activity in order to reduce effort put in a single instance. Ideally incremental updates are recommended.

- Identify business pain-points (eg.: increase in churn rate)

- Analyze the effort goes in managing the current pain points , industry threshold is 30% investment

- Create and prioritize business feature roadmap

- Map these high prioritized features and pain-points with new product design

- Analyze what are the components and sub-systems that can be updated with least effort to facilitate new designs

- Do a complete ROI map

- Based on the notion that with least effort maximum business value start implement new technology updates

- Once the update is completed, assess the impact and cost
